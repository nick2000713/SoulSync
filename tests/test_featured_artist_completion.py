"""Regression tests for featured-artist track matching.

Discord-reported scenario: a single "super single" by Artist1 feat.
Artist2 also appears on the album "super album" (Artist1). When the
album is fully owned, Artist1's discography shows the single as
complete, but Artist2's discography (which lists the same track as
their own single) shows it as missing — even though the same
recording exists in the library under Artist1's album.

Two layers of fix pinned by these tests:

- Scanner: store ALL Jellyfin/Emby ArtistItems in tracks.track_artist
  (joined with "; "), not just ArtistItems[0]. The first artist
  often equals the album artist and used to suppress the row.
- Scoring: split track_artist on common multi-artist delimiters
  (",", ";", "&", "feat.", "ft.", "featuring", "vs.", "x") and
  score each piece independently against the search artist.
