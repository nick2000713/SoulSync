"""The dashboard sync band's history feed must filter by type SERVER-side.

Boulder, Aug 2026: three playlists (Discover Weekly, ListenBrainz Weekly Jams,
ListenBrainz Top Discoveries) showed "no runs yet" on the dashboard and would
not open, while their pipelines were completing fine — 58, 21 and 22 completed
runs respectively, the latest that same afternoon.

The band asks the history feed for N rows and matches each schedule to its own
latest run by name. The feed fetched 10 rows and then dropped the album ones in
javascript, so five recent album downloads left five playlist runs for eight
schedules to match against. Three lost, and a row with no run was also not
clickable, which is why those playlists would not open.

A filter after LIMIT is not a filter.
