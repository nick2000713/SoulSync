"""Regression tests for soundtrack/compilation track-artist matching.

The Discord-reported bug: a Vaiana OST track ("Where You Are" by
Christopher Jackson) failed to match against a Plex/Emby library
because the album's primary artist was Lin-Manuel Miranda. SoulSync's
DB stores the per-track artist in ``tracks.track_artist`` (from
Plex's ``originalTitle`` or Jellyfin's ``ArtistItems[0]``), but the
confidence scorer only compared against the album-artist JOIN and
never looked at ``track_artist``.

These tests pin the new behaviour:

- ``_calculate_track_confidence`` scores against ``track_artist`` too,
  taking the better artist similarity, so soundtrack tracks credited
  to the actual performer match.
- ``_rows_to_tracks`` propagates ``track_artist`` from row to object.
- The album-aware fallback constructs DatabaseTrack with the right
  dataclass fields (it used to TypeError on every row).
