"""A finding whose subject is a bare integer predates Library v2 — decline it.

Every repair job that has a catalogue subject now emits ``lib2:<row_id>``; a bare
integer is a legacy back-reference by contract (T-12). The ``_fix_*`` handlers
still carried a second, legacy implementation behind that check — a whole
``else`` branch per handler that read and mutated ``artists``/``albums``/
``tracks``. It is unreachable from any scan the code can still produce, which is
exactly the property that makes it dangerous: it is the version whose breakage
nobody notices, and it deletes rows.

What can still arrive at a handler with a bare id is a *stale* finding — one
persisted before the job moved to native subjects and never applied. It names a
row in a catalogue that is gone, so it is refused, and the startup prune drops
it so the next scan can raise it again against the right subject.

A finding with **no** entity id at all is a different thing and must keep
working: ``track_number_repair``'s folder scan raises findings about a file on
disk that the catalogue does not know, and its fix is a pure retag.
