"""Issue 1: container-style stored paths must resolve via the shared library
path resolver — with the config manager injected.

Root cause: both ``core/sample/worker.py::_resolve_existing_path`` and the
inline copy in ``api/sample.py::_resolve_source_path`` called
``resolve_library_file_path(stored)`` WITHOUT a config manager, so the
resolver had no base directories to walk against and the fallback was dead.
On a native install whose DB holds Docker-style paths
(``/mnt/musicBackup/…``), every track reported "not reachable on disk".

Covered here:
- ``resolve_audio_path`` translates a container-style stored path against
  the configured ``library.music_paths`` (the Broque case).
- Without an injected config manager it still returns None (honest miss).
- ``_resolve_source_path`` funnels through the same resolver and its
  FILE_MISSING error names the stored path.
