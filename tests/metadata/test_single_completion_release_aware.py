"""SeadogsBooty (Oct 2026): artist-page single ownership must be release-aware.

The 1-track single path in ``check_single_completion`` used to call
``db.check_track_exists(title, artist)`` with no release context, so a
single whose song is also on an album showed OWNED as soon as the album
track existed in the library — while the download analysis
(``owned_release_tracks``, release-level) correctly reported it missing.
The artist page and the Begin Analysis modal disagreed.

The fix: the single path now resolves the library RELEASE first (the same
strict + year-gated release lookup the EP path and the download analysis
use), then applies two single-specific guards, then credits the single only
if its track is on THAT release:

- release-kind gate: a single card is never satisfied by a known album-kind
  library row (the #1289 Deezer reissue-date exemption can skip the year
  gate for a same-titled album);
- track-count guard: a 1-track card is never the same release as a 4+ track
  row (codebase single/EP/album cutoffs: <=3 single, <=6 EP).

Unknown kinds/counts stay lenient, and the #1071 id-proof rescue still
applies. All hermetic: temp DB, no network.
