"""A finding whose file is gone must not sit in the list for ever.

Findings store their own snapshot of a path. Nothing ever closed one whose file
had since been moved, replaced or deleted, so a scan's stale momentary view
stayed on screen with a Fix button that could only ever fail — the reported case
was three Corrupt Audio findings naming files that no longer existed.

The one thing a sweep must never do is retire findings because THIS process
cannot see the library (a Docker install whose catalogue holds the media
server's paths would lose every finding it has). So a finding is retired only
when its containing folder is right there and the file is not: the folder is the
proof that we are looking at the real library.
