"""#1067 (QT3496) — discography gap-fill: "show me what my source is missing."

The dedup rule is the whole risk surface, so it gets the heavy testing:
conservative same-release matching (normalized title + compatible years,
edition markers kept so distinct editions never merge), cross-source and
cross-bucket dedup, and source-order priority for contested gaps. Endpoint
and frontend are pinned at source level: gap-fill only consults sources with
a VERIFIED enriched artist id (never fuzzy name search), fetches with
fallback disabled, and only ever appends cards.
