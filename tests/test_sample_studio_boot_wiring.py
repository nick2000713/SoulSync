"""sample studio resolves track files with the same resolver playback uses.

core.sample.worker.configure() was never called at boot, so the worker ran
with no config manager and the shared resolver had no base dirs to walk. a
track whose stored path wasn't literal on disk (docker/plex/navidrome layout)
played fine but failed analysis, peaks, preview, chop and stems with "audio
file not reachable on disk". the tests in tests/sample inject configure()
themselves, which is how the missing wiring hid.
