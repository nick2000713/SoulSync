"""Deep-scan stale-track removal must never run on listings pulled while the
media server itself is mid-rescan — for EVERY server type whose client can
report its scan state, not just Navidrome.

PR #1346 fenced the mid-rescan hazard for Navidrome only
(``server_type == "navidrome"``), but Plex and Jellyfin ship the same
``is_library_scanning()`` probe. A weekly deep scan racing the server's own
rescan sees HTTP-200-but-transiently-incomplete listings: every partial
answer looks "fully trusted", the 50% guard is bypassed, and live tracks are
deleted as stale — the exact 2500-track shape from Specialmed's report.

The probe must also fail CLOSED: if ``is_library_scanning()`` raises while
the stale set is large, deletion must be skipped, not attempted.
