"""No maintenance job may treat the atomic staging tree as library content.

Boulder, on the staging relocation: "i thought soulsync had an actual staging
folder as well. but i was thinking, if its going in either transfer or staging
folder, would that just create issues."

It would, and this is that issue. Moving atomic-publish staging INSIDE the
transfer dir fixed the Docker permission failure, but the transfer dir is
walked by a family of library-maintenance jobs, and two of them DELETE things:

  * ``orphan_file_detector`` treats any audio file under transfer that is not
    in the database as an orphan. Staged tracks are deliberately not in the
    database until publish, so every one of them qualifies.
  * ``empty_folder_cleaner`` removes empty directories bottom-up. A staging
    tree mid-download is full of album folders whose files have not landed yet.
  * ``duplicate_cleaner`` would see the staged copy and the published copy of
    the same track as duplicates.
  * ``quality_upgrade_scanner`` would probe half-landed files and propose
    upgrades for tracks not yet in the library.

The prune is path-based rather than name-based because ``empty_folder_cleaner``
walks bottom-up, where mutating ``dirs`` in place does nothing at all.
