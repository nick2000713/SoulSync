"""Tests for the additive schema_migrations ledger + PRAGMA user_version backstop.

The ledger unifies the previously-scattered migration state (marker tables +
metadata flags) into one readable place so a half-migrated DB is detectable.
It is NON-GATING: nothing decides whether a migration runs based on it.
