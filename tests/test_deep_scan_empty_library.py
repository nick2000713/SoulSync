"""Deep scan vs an empty/shrunken library selection (#stale-artists, 5BILLION).

Switching the library selection (All Libraries → one) and deep-scanning used to
fail two ways:
  • an EMPTY selected library errored out ("No artists found") before stale
    removal ever ran — the old selection's artists stayed forever
  • a SMALL selected library tripped the >50%-stale safety guard, silently
    skipping removal

The fix makes the fetch verifiable: _get_all_artists marks whether the server
actually ANSWERED (a real list) vs the fetch failing. A verified-empty answer
is confirmed with a second fetch, then stale removal proceeds; the 50% guard
is bypassed only for a fully-trusted scan (verified fetch + zero per-artist
failures + not stopped). Every failure path keeps the old conservative
behavior: error out, remove nothing.
