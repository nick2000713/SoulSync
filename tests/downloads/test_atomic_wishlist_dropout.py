"""The wishlist dropout that atomic album publishing opened (#1289).

#999 moved the moment a track becomes visible in the library from per-track
post-processing to batch completion, and left the wishlist removal at per-track
post-processing. Between the two the track was in neither the library nor the
wishlist, and that gap lasts until the LAST track of the album finishes — so a
restart, a failed publish or a cancel inside it destroyed both the file's
visibility and the only durable record that anyone had asked for it.

The tests that would have caught it are the first and the fourth here: a staged
track whose process never reaches the publish, and a batch force-errored before
any publish attempt. Everything else guards a path that fed the same drain.
