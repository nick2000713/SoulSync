"""Tests for ``core/downloads/file_finder.py``.

Real-world regression these tests pin: the Soulseek album-bundle
post-process previously had its own three-candidate probe for the
local downloaded file. When slskd was configured to nest downloads
under a username subdir (a common config) NONE of the three
candidates matched, the poll silently timed out 22 minutes later,
and the batch went to "failed" even though slskd had successfully
downloaded every track of the album. The per-track download path
already used the recursive-walk finder and worked fine — these
tests pin the lifted shared finder so both paths now find files
no matter what layout slskd writes.

Issue: #715 (Billy Ocean — Download album task fails after slskd
finishes downloading release).
