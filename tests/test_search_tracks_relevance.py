"""Find & Add library search relevance (Billie Eilish 'bad guy' report).

Root cause proven against the real DB: `ORDER BY tracks.title` is case-SENSITIVE
(SQLite BINARY sorts 'B' before 'b'), so a lowercase exact title like Billie
Eilish's "bad guy" sorted BELOW every capitalised "Bad Guy" and fell past the
result LIMIT — it never showed in the modal even though it was in the library.

Fix: rank by relevance (exact title first, case-insensitive), and accept a
rank-only artist hint so an exact title+artist match wins — without FILTERING
(filtering would re-hide the track if it's tagged under a slightly different
artist on the server).
