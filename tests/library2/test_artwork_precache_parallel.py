"""docs/library-v2.md §17.6 — precache_all_artwork must dispatch its
per-entity ``build_artwork`` calls to a bounded ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` instead
of building one artist/album at a time. For a first-time migration of
thousands of tracks, each uncached album/artist can trigger a synchronous
provider network call, so a serial loop is the actual "import takes forever"
bottleneck (see docs §17.6). Artwork has a bounded I/O-oriented default of 6,
an optional ``library_v2.artwork_cache_workers`` knob, and retains
``auto_import.max_workers`` as its compatibility fallback.
