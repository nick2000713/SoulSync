"""Sample Studio API (Phase 1) — analysis + waveform peaks.

Phase 3 — chop rendering + stash: POST /sample/preview (fast librosa
render for auditioning pitch/BPM changes), POST /sample/chop (final render
+ stash row), stash CRUD, ZIP export.

Registered on the /api/v1 blueprint via register_routes (see api/__init__.py),
same @require_api_key auth as the other v1 modules.

Phase 2 addition: the web UI talks to the legacy session-auth /api/* routes
(webui/src/app/api-client.ts has no API key), so the pure service functions
below are shared with thin legacy wrappers in web_server.py
(/api/sample/analysis, /api/sample/analyze, /api/sample/peaks, …).
