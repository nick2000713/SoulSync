"""Library Manager v2 — UI-facing API (native catalogue, Lidarr-style).

Routes are mounted directly on the Flask ``app`` under ``/api/library/v2/*``.

Design notes:
- **Artwork is media-server-independent.** Image URLs returned here point at the
  local ``/api/library/v2/artwork/<kind>/<id>`` endpoint, which resolves art from the
  files' own embedded covers (or metadata providers) and caches it on local disk —
  never from Plex/Jellyfin/Navidrome (see ``core/library2/artwork.py``).
- **Monitoring mirrors the existing systems.** Toggling an artist's monitor flag
  also adds/removes it from the WATCHLIST; an album/single/track monitor mirrors to
  the WISHLIST — via internal DB calls, so existing scan/auto-download keeps working.

Registered from ``web_server.py`` via ``register_library_v2_routes(app, ...)``.

    submits a manual wishlist batch scoped to exactly those ids (same
    executors/pools ``/api/wishlist/download_missing`` uses) — the scoped
    Automatic Search endpoint (C1) hands it the ids currently wanted in an
    artist/album scope after mirroring them fresh into the wishlist.

    ``/api/watchlist/artist/<id>/config`` endpoint already does (§52.5/§56.2);
    injected for the same circular-import reason as ``run_enrichment``.

    ``make_context_key(username, filename) -> str`` and
    ``get_cached_transfer_data() -> dict`` are the same helpers
    ``/api/downloads/status`` uses to read live slskd/streaming transfer
    progress — injected (rather than imported) for the same circular-import
