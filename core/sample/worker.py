"""Sample Studio analysis worker — one daemon thread, in-memory FIFO queue.

Why not the repair worker: that daemon rotates whole-library sweeps on a
staleness schedule and is disabled by default. Analysis is per-track,
on-demand work ("track imported" / "user opened it in Studio") that must run
whether or not the user enabled library maintenance.

Why an in-memory queue and not a DB queue table: gunicorn runs a single worker
process (workers=1, gthread), so one in-process queue cannot double-run. The
DB row is the idempotency guard — a track already analyzed at the current
ANALYZER_VERSION is skipped, so a restart or duplicate enqueue is harmless.
Anything still pending at shutdown is re-enqueued lazily the next time the
track is opened in Studio (GET /api/v1/sample/analysis enqueues on miss).
