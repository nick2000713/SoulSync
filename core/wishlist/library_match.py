"""Deciding that the library already owns a wishlisted track (#1289).

Two places clear wishlist rows on the grounds that the track is already in the
library: the auto-wishlist cleanup in :mod:`core.wishlist.processing` and the
post-batch cleanup in :mod:`core.downloads.cleanup`. Both asked
``check_track_exists`` and both deleted the row on a hit, and neither looked at
what they had actually matched.

The hole that matters is a row whose ``file_path`` points INTO the atomic
staging tree. Those rows are real — ``record_soulsync_library_entry`` writes
one for every staged track on a ``soulsync`` server, which is exactly why the
publish has to repoint them — but the file they name is invisible to the media
server and may never be published at all. Matching against one and deleting the
wishlist row means the request is gone while the audio is still quarantined:
the same dropout the atomic-publish fix closes, arriving by a different door.

What this module deliberately does NOT do is require the matched file to exist
on disk. Rows sourced from Plex/Jellyfin/Navidrome carry those servers' paths,
which routinely do not resolve inside SoulSync's container, so treating absence
as disproof would reject every legitimate match and re-download a whole library.
Absence is not evidence here; a staging path is.
