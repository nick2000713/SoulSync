"""The precondition on deleting a wishlist row (#1289).

A wishlist row is the only durable record that a user asked for a track. There
is no tombstone, no pending state and no audit trail behind it: ``success=True``
runs a ``DELETE`` and the request is gone. So the question "is this download
actually finished?" has to be answered before the delete, not assumed by it.

Three separate code paths assumed it, and each one lost tracks:

  * Atomic album publishing (#999) redirects a finished track to a path under
    ``.soulsync_atomic_staging``, which every scanner and media server skips by
    design. The per-track completion callback deleted the wishlist row there —
    minutes to hours before the album actually published, and unconditionally,
    so a restart, a failed publish or a cancel in that window left the user with
    neither a library file nor a request to retry.
  * The verification worker's "no matched context" branch reports success for a
    file that is still sitting in the downloads folder, never imported.
  * The completion callback in ``lifecycle`` builds its context out of
    ``track_info`` alone, so it had no path to check even in principle.

The guard below is the one place that decides, and it decides from the file:
a wishlist row may be deleted for a completed download only when the caller can
name a file that exists and is not staged. Everything else keeps the row, which
is the self-healing direction — a track that is already in the library and
still on the wishlist gets cleared by the already-owned cleanup, whereas a track
that is on neither is gone for good.
