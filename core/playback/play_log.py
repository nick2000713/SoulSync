"""Build a listening-history event from a SoulSync web-player play.

Pure, DB-agnostic. ``listening_history`` is otherwise populated only from the
media server (Plex/Jellyfin/Navidrome) by ``listening_stats_worker``; this lets
the WEB PLAYER record its own plays too, so "recently played" and the Phase-2
smart-radio recency signal reflect what was actually played in SoulSync.

Kept as a pure function so it's unit-testable without a DB or Flask: it
normalizes the player's track payload into the exact event shape
``MusicDatabase.insert_listening_events`` expects.
