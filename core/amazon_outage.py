"""Amazon enrichment outage detection + back-off — pure, importable, testable.

The Amazon worker enriches via a public T2Tunes proxy instance. When that
instance is down (HTTP 5xx, "Amazon Music API is not initialized", or an
unreachable host), the worker must NOT treat every album as an individual
failure: doing so floods the logs with an error per item, churns network + DB
continuously, and permanently marks the whole library ``error`` (which the
retry tiers never re-attempt) for what is really a transient outage.

Instead it recognizes "the whole source is down", leaves the item untouched so
it's retried once the instance recovers, and backs off hard. These two pure
helpers carry that logic so it can be unit-tested without the worker, the DB,
or the network.
