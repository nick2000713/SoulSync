"""The one place that maps a Watchlist provider name to its id column.

Audit finding P1-05: the native Watchlist contract only carried a bare
``artist_id``, so the database had to *guess* the provider from the id's shape —
"all digits means iTunes, anything else means Spotify". That is wrong for every
numeric-id provider (Deezer, Discogs) and for MusicBrainz UUIDs, and Amazon was
missing from the update/remove mappings entirely. A client could not reliably
put a non-Spotify artist on the watchlist, and a later scan could not resolve it.

Callers that know the provider should pass it explicitly; ``infer_source`` stays
as the documented legacy fallback for requests written before ``source`` existed.
