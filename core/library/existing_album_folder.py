"""Reuse an album's existing on-disk folder for new downloads (#829).

When tracks are added to an album across multiple batches (a wishlist run, the
Album Completeness job, a missed track re-downloaded later), the destination
folder is normally rebuilt from API metadata each time. If ``$albumtype`` or
``$year`` come back blank/different on a later batch, the folder *name* changes
and the album splits across folders — forcing a Reorganize afterwards.

This resolves the folder the album *already* lives in so the new track joins its
existing files instead. Matching is deliberately conservative: the exact stored
Spotify album id first (definitive), then a STRICT (>= 0.85) name+artist match —
higher than the 0.7 used elsewhere, because a wrong match here misplaces a file.

Safety rails:
  * Only ever returns a folder UNDER the transfer dir (the managed download
    tree) — never a read-only library/NAS mount the resolver happens to find.
  * Only reuses when the album lives in EXACTLY ONE folder on disk. Multiple
    folders means disc subfolders (DatabaseTrack carries no disc number, so we
    can't safely pick the right one) — those defer to the template path.
  * Never reuses another release's folder. Two releases can share a title and
    differ only by musicbrainz's disambiguation (#1299); the album's release id
    (db row, else the files' own tags) has to agree before its folder is reused.
  * Never lets a smaller release join a bigger edition's folder: when the
    incoming release's own track total is known and the existing roster is
    larger, it is a different edition (a 12-track standard vs a 16-track
    deluxe) and the template path builds its own folder instead. A total of
    1 doesn't count as known — it is album.py's unknown-fallback — so lone
    thin-metadata tracks keep today's reuse.
  * Never merges different release kinds: a single/EP named after its lead
    track ("Ocean Avenue") must not join the album of the same name's folder
    — the file would collide with the album's title track and the single
    would never exist as its own release. When both the incoming type and
    the stored album row's type are known and differ, reuse is refused and
    the template builds the single/EP its own folder. Unknown on either side
    stays lenient (today's reuse) so thin metadata never splits a real album.
  * Any failure returns None — the caller falls back to the normal template.
