"""The music-side deleted quarantine, made browsable.

files removed by the repair worker and the duplicate cleaner don't die -
they move into <transfer>/.deleted with their path relative to the transfer
folder preserved. that made them recoverable in principle but invisible in
practice: no listing, no restore, no idea when something was put there.

this module is that missing layer. movers call record_deleted_entry() right
after their shutil.move so a manifest at the quarantine root remembers the
original absolute path, when it was deleted, and which tool did it. listing
walks the folder (manifest or not - files quarantined before the manifest
existed still show up, just with less detail), restore puts a file back
where it came from, purge deletes it for real.

retention: entries older than library.deleted_keep_days are purged
opportunistically on every list. 0 (the default) keeps everything forever -
nothing changes for anyone who doesn't opt in. only files the manifest has
a deleted_at for are age-purged: a move preserves the file's original
mtime, so aging unmanifested files by mtime would purge a fresh delete of
an old file on day one.

ids handed to the api are "<root-tag>:<relative path>" - "deleted" for the
canonical .deleted root, "legacy" for a bare deleted folder that could not
be renamed (see deleted_quarantine_root). every id is traversal-checked
before any filesystem op.
