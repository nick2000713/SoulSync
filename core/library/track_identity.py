"""Match a metadata-source track against the library by stable external IDs.

Discord-reported (CAL): the watchlist scanner re-downloaded a track that
already existed on disk because the library DB had stale album metadata
(track tagged on album "Left Alone" while Spotify reported it as on the
"NPC" single). The matching logic relied on title + artist + album fuzzy
comparison; the album fuzzy correctly said the names didn't match, the
scanner declared the track missing, and the wishlist re-added + re-
downloaded it on every scan.

The track has a stable external identity though — every download embeds
Spotify / iTunes / Deezer / Tidal / Qobuz / MusicBrainz / AudioDB /
Hydrabase / ISRC IDs as both file tags AND DB columns. This module pulls
those IDs off either side and asks: do we already have a row in the
``tracks`` table whose external-ID column matches one of the source
track's IDs? If yes, the track is NOT missing, regardless of how the
album metadata drifted between sources.

Provider-neutral by design — no spotify-only paths.
