"""Reconcile provider IDs embedded in audio files into the library DB.

Enrichment workers (Spotify / iTunes / MusicBrainz / Deezer / Tidal /
AudioDB / Genius / Last.fm) resolve each artist / album / track to a provider ID
via API calls, gating their work queues on ``{provider}_match_status IS
NULL``. But files that SoulSync (or MusicBrainz Picard) already tagged
carry those IDs in their metadata. Reading them back and gap-filling the
``{provider}_id`` + ``{provider}_match_status = 'matched'`` columns lets
the workers skip the API lookup entirely — large API savings on an
already-tagged library.

Gap-fill only: lib2's ``claim_provider_id`` writes an id only while the
column is empty, in one statement, so an enrichment worker that matched the
entity meanwhile keeps its value; a DISAGREEING embedded id is counted as a
conflict. The artist a file's ``*_artist_id`` tag names is resolved through
``lib2_track_artists`` -- that tag describes who performed the TRACK, so on a
compilation or a featured track it is not the album's primary artist and must
not be written there.

The MusicBrainz *recording* id is reconciled too. picard and soulsync's
own writer agree on where it lives: the ID3 ``UFID`` frame (which the shared
reader now surfaces) and the Vorbis ``musicbrainz_trackid`` field. without
it an mp3 kept every musicbrainz id but the recording, while its flac twin
had one, so the two copies didn't look like the same song. only a real
MBID-shaped value is filled, so an old tagger that put something else in
``musicbrainz_trackid`` can't plant junk.
