"""DownloadEngine — central owner of cross-source download operations.

The engine owns the live source catalog (including aliases/unavailable
sources), active-download state, background workers, throttling, aggregate
status/cancel operations, hybrid search and final source dispatch. Individual
plugins retain source-specific protocol/authentication and their atomic
search/download implementations.

``DownloadOrchestrator`` remains the compatibility facade and policy layer; it
delegates source resolution and operational dispatch to this class.
