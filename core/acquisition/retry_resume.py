"""Resume interrupted acquisition retry walks after a process restart.

When a quarantine retry is mid-walk and the process restarts, the in-memory
``download_tasks`` entry is gone but its journaled state survives
(``core/acquisition/retry_state.py``). On the next acquisition worker cycle
this module rebuilds the exact legacy task — track context from the persisted
import plan, cached candidates, used and exhausted sources, retry counters —
and resubmits the EXISTING download worker. All selection, source-priority and
retry decisions stay in the shared task_worker/monitor machinery
(docs/library-v2.md §8); this module only restores state.
