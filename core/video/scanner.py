"""SoulSync — video library scanner.

The media SERVER (Plex/Jellyfin) is the source of truth, exactly like the music
side: we ask the server what it has and mirror it into video.db. This module is
server-agnostic — it consumes a "video media source" (duck-typed) that yields
normalized dicts, so it never touches a media-server SDK directly. The Plex /
Jellyfin adapters live in core/video/sources.py.

A source must provide:
    source.server_name -> 'plex' | 'jellyfin'
    source.iter_movies(incremental=False) -> iterable of normalized movie dicts
    source.iter_shows(incremental=False)  -> iterable of normalized show dicts

Scan MODES (mirroring the music side's full_refresh / incremental / deep_scan):
    'incremental' - only recently-added items from the server; upsert; no prune.
    'full'        - every item; upsert all (refresh metadata + add new); no prune.
    'deep'        - every item; upsert; PRUNE what the server no longer has.

ISOLATION: imports only video.db + shared infra; music never imports this.
