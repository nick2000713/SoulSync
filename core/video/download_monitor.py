"""Background monitor that drives video downloads to completion.

A daemon thread polls the active video downloads — slskd transfers AND
torrent/usenet client jobs (``client_download``) — updates their progress +
live speed/ETA, and when one finishes runs the importer (parse → verify →
templated rename into the right Movies / TV / YouTube library folder), with
auto-retry through the ranked candidates and requery when they run dry.

The per-download decision (``process_download``) is pure — filesystem + slskd are
injected — so it's unit-tested; the thread loop is thin glue.

Isolated: stdlib + the sibling video modules + shared config_manager; no music imports.
