"""Monitor a torrent/usenet video download to completion + hand the file to the importer.

The Soulseek path polls slskd transfers; this is the parallel path for torrent/usenet grabs.
``process_client_download`` is PURE (all I/O injected) and returns the SAME patch shape as
``download_monitor.process_download`` — so the monitor's existing progress/failure/completion/
history handling works unchanged. Production wiring reuses the SHARED torrent/usenet client
adapters + ``resolve_reported_save_path`` (music-safe: imported + called, never modified).
