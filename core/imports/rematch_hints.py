"""Re-identify hints (#889) — a single-use, user-designated answer to "which
release does this already-imported track belong to".

Flow: the user clicks *Re-identify* on a library track, searches a source, and
picks the exact release (single / EP / album) it should live under. We write a
**hint** here and stage the file for auto-import. The import flow then reads the
hint at the very TOP of matching — before any fuzzy tier — builds the match from
these exact IDs, and consumes the row. So the original ambiguity that mis-filed
the track (which release?) is gone: the user already answered it.

Two safety properties live in the hint, not the import code:

- ``replace_track_id`` — the library row to delete AFTER the re-import lands (so a
  re-identify *replaces* rather than *duplicates*). Cleanup is deferred to success
  so a failed import can never lose the file.
- ``exempt_dedup`` — always set: a re-identify is an explicit user action and must
  not be silently dropped by the quality dedup-skip (which would otherwise see the
  incoming file as a duplicate of the very row we're replacing).

This module is pure DB mechanics over an injected ``cursor`` (sqlite3-style,
``?`` params) — no connection management, no app state — so the create / find /
consume seam is unit-tested against an in-memory DB with no live metadata client.
The binding is keyed on the staged path, with ``content_hash`` as a rename-proof
fallback in case the staging watcher normalizes the filename on ingest.
