"""Album-level ReplayGain analysis for Library v2.

Reuses the proven analysis + tag-writing primitives from ``core/replaygain.py``
(the same ones the legacy Enhanced View uses) and only owns the Library-v2
orchestration: pick the album's present files, resolve them through the lib2
path resolver, run the two-pass album-gain computation, and write track- and
album-level ReplayGain tags under the shared per-file lock.

The FFmpeg analysis and mutagen write functions are injectable so the
orchestration is unit-testable without invoking real FFmpeg; production callers
use the defaults from ``core/replaygain.py``.
