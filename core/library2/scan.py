"""Re-read audio files' real properties into ``lib2_track_files``.

The importer seeds file rows from the legacy DB, which only reliably knows
format+bitrate. "Refresh & Scan" calls this to probe each file on disk
(``core/imports/file_ops.probe_audio_quality`` — mutagen, ground truth) so
sample-rate/bit-depth-based quality targets (hi-res FLAC tiers) evaluate
against real values instead of format-based fallbacks.

Files whose path does not exist are left untouched (bind mounts can be
temporarily absent in Docker; a missing path is not proof the file is gone).
