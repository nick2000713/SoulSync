"""Read-only live download-queue status for Library-v2 rows (docs §73, I6).

Scans the two existing in-flight tracking structures — ``download_tasks``
(batch/wishlist path) and ``matched_downloads_context`` (manual-grab path,
docs §71) — filtered to a caller-supplied set of lib2 track ids. Both already
carry the lib2 track/album id (``track_info.source_info`` /
``lib2_entity``); this module just surfaces it. Terminal/idle tracks are
simply absent from the result — there is no persisted "last known outcome"
here, the existing quality/verification badges already cover completed and
failed results (docs §73.2).

Deliberately dependency-free of ``web_server`` (mirrors ``core/downloads/
status.py``'s ``StatusDeps`` precedent): ``make_context_key`` and
``get_cached_transfer_data`` are injected by the caller.
