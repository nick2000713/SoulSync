"""Per-track quality evaluation against an app-wide quality profile.

Reuses SoulSync's existing quality model (``core/quality``): a profile is a set of
ranked targets; a file's ``AudioQuality`` either meets them or not, and — depending
on the profile's ``upgrade_policy`` — may still be an *upgrade candidate* even when
it's "acceptable":

- ``acceptable``:   good enough once it matches ANY ranked target.
- ``until_cutoff``: keep proposing upgrades until the target at
  ``upgrade_cutoff_index`` (or better) is reached — Lidarr's quality cutoff.
- ``until_top``:    legacy alias for ``until_cutoff`` with cutoff 0.

Profiles are rows of the app-wide ``quality_profiles`` table (the same rows the
wishlist/download pipeline resolves via ``core/quality/selection``), so the
badges here and the pipeline's accept/upgrade decisions can't drift apart.

This is the read-side that powers the "meets profile / upgrade available" badges and
feeds the upgrade search. Never raises — unknown/unreadable quality is treated as
satisfying the profile so nothing is falsely flagged.
