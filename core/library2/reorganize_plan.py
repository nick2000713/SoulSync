"""Where a Library-v2 album's files belong, computed from the catalogue alone.

Reorganize used to answer this by asking a metadata provider for the album's
tracklist and naming files after what came back. The library's own values were
pulled in one exception at a time — ``_keep_user_casing`` for the album name
(#1078), again for the track title (#1078), ``_keep_user_year`` for the year
(#1080). Three patches, each added after a report, each saying the same thing:
where the catalogue and the provider disagreed, the catalogue was right.

So this planner reads the catalogue and nothing else. Consequences, all
intended:

* An album with no stored source id is reorganizable. The old planner refused
  it outright (``status: 'no_source_id'``) — for an operation that moves a
  file, which needs no provider at all.
* The plan is offline. No 4.4s preview, and no ``Invalid base62 id`` 400s from
  candidate ids that were never Spotify's to begin with.
* The filename matches what the Library page shows, hand-set titles included,
  because both read through the same ``project_metadata`` override layer.
* ``total_discs`` comes from the discs the catalogue knows rather than from a
  live tracklist, which is how a half-downloaded album's layout oscillated
  between ``Disc N/`` and flat (#1080).

The cost is stated rather than hidden: a manual match no longer changes the
path by itself. Re-tag moves a provider's values into the catalogue;
reorganize applies the template to what the catalogue says.

The path is still built by ``core.imports.paths.build_final_path_for_track``
through the same context shape post-processing uses, so a reorganize
destination and a fresh download's destination cannot drift apart.
