"""Pure read helpers for Library v2: quality tiers and metadata-gap detection.

These are deliberately side-effect-free and do **not** read files from disk — the
request path must stay fast, so the API computes status from DB columns plus the
cached ``tags_json`` / ``metadata_gaps_json`` snapshots written at import/scan time.
A later background scan can refresh those snapshots by actually reading file tags
(reusing the repair-job tag readers); this module only interprets what's already
stored.
