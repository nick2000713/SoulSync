"""Map media-server identities onto an existing Library-v2 catalogue.

After the upgrade, a server scan is not an ownership/import path. Catalogue and
file rows come from the import/download pipeline; a server only stamps its own
IDs and technical observations onto those existing rows. ``allow_create`` is
reserved for that pipeline's shared helpers.

Three rules run through every upsert here:

**Match by the server id, fall back to identity, then stamp.** A rating key is
not stable — a library rescan hands out new ones, which is why the legacy code
carried a whole "ratingKey migrated" dance that copied enrichment onto a new
row. A catalogue row has its own id, so a changed rating key is nothing but a
new stamp on the row we already had.

**The server is only an identity/technical observer.** It may stamp its own id
and refresh track/disc number, duration, size and bitrate.  It does not create
catalogue or file ownership and does not replace provider/import metadata.

**A file is a row** (ADR-03). The server's path/size/bitrate land on
``lib2_track_files``, not on the track.
