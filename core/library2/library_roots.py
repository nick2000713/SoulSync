"""Whose library a file belongs to follows from where it is (#1199, E-15).

Every library is a folder: the shared transfer folder, and one output folder
per profile that keeps a library of its own. So the owner of a file is not a
fact to be carried from the download that produced it through five worker
threads and stamped at the end -- it is a function of the file's path, and it
can be recomputed at any time.

That is what this module keeps true. ``lib2_library_roots`` holds one row per
library folder (``profile_id`` 0 = the shared library), and two triggers on
``lib2_track_files`` set ``owner_profile_id`` from the LONGEST matching prefix
whenever a row is inserted or its path changes. An own folder inside the shared
one is therefore that profile's, and a file a reorganize moves between two
libraries changes hands with the move.

Why triggers and not a helper at each writer: some twenty places write
``lib2_track_files.path`` (imports, the atomic publish, reorganize, the repair
fixes, path-drift reconcile, the importer), and upstream adds new ones every
release. A rule enforced by the table cannot be forgotten by the next writer.

Why pure SQL: a trigger that called a Python function would make every write
fail on a connection that did not register it (tests, tools, a raw sqlite3).

A path under no known folder keeps whatever its writer stamped. That is the
legacy import's owner, or a media-server path this process cannot map.
