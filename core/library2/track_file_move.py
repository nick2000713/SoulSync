"""Move a file link between two Library-v2 track rows (single ↔ album).

The missing third option next to "dedup (delete the single's file)" and
"unlink (they're not the same recording)": the user has ONE physical file
attached to the wrong release variant — re-home it without re-downloading or
deleting anything.

What moves is the ``lib2_track_files`` row (the DB's file↔track link). The
file on disk is NOT touched: renaming/refoldering to the target release's
naming scheme is the reorganize job's business, which reads the corrected
library state afterwards. That keeps this operation instant, reversible and
safe on bind mounts.

After the move the SOURCE track has no file (shows "missing" again). To keep
the pipeline from immediately re-downloading the variant the user just
consolidated away, the source track is unmonitored and its wishlist mirror is
withdrawn — an explicit monitor toggle re-wants it any time.
