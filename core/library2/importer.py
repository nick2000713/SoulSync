"""Import the existing (legacy) library into the Library v2 ``lib2_*`` tables.

This reads the legacy ``artists`` / ``albums`` / ``tracks`` tables **read-only** and
populates the v2 schema. It is:

- **Idempotent / re-runnable** — rows are keyed on their ``legacy_*_id`` so a second
  run reconciles instead of duplicating. ``reset=True`` wipes ``lib2_*`` first for a
  clean rebuild.
- **Defensive about columns** — the legacy schema has many migration-added columns
  that vary by install, so every SELECT is built from the columns that actually
  exist (``_existing_columns``).
- **Multi-artist aware** — a track's primary artist is its album artist; additional
  credits are parsed from the legacy ``track_artist`` field and from ``feat.`` /
  ``ft.`` markers in the title (``split_artist_credits``) and linked through the
  ``lib2_track_artists`` junction so the song is stored once but shows under each
  artist.
- **Single-vs-album aware** — after import, the same recording appearing both as a
  ``single`` and on a regular album is linked via ``canonical_track_id``
  (``link_single_album_duplicates``).

    optional callback for UI progress. ``profile_id`` scopes the watchlist/

    keeps the interrupted attempt's ``run_id`` so the snapshot reconcile still

    nothing left to continue after the tables are wiped.

    A progress callback may opt into the extra checkpoint data by carrying a
    truthy ``lib2_resume_aware`` attribute; it is then called as

      or name),
    - a track found on the **wishlist** is monitored (matched by Spotify id).

    Album/single monitor flags are explicit Library-v2 state. Toggling an album
    in the UI still mirrors its tracks to the wishlist, but importing an existing
    wishlisted song does not turn the parent release into an album-level monitor.

    Artist flags follow the watchlist table. Track flags are Library-v2 state:
    wishlist rows turn tracks on, but successful downloads or explicit user
    choices must not be turned off just because the wishlist row disappeared.
    No-op when those tables are absent (unit-test DBs).

    ``profile_id`` is restricted to the admin watchlist/wishlist so Library v2
    cannot leak another profile's wanted state into its global flags. ``None``
    means admin profile 1.
