"""Persistent, server-scoped recognition mappings for Library v2.

Media servers observe an imported catalogue; they do not own it.  A separate
mapping row lets the same artist/release/track be recognised by Plex,
Jellyfin, and Navidrome at the same time without one scan overwriting another.
The old ``server_source``/``server_id`` entity columns remain a compatibility
projection while older call sites and existing databases converge.
