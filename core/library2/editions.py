"""Release Edition + Recording model for Library v2 (audit P1-04 / ADR-04).

``lib2_albums`` used to be BOTH the abstract album idea and one concrete
provider release; deluxe/remaster/country pressings collapsed into whichever
row got imported first, and duplicate detection had nothing but normalized
titles to work with (P1-04/P1-05).

ADR-04 models both levels, Lidarr-style (Album/AlbumRelease):

- **Release group** — the existing ``lib2_albums`` row keeps this role:
  artist credits, title, type, group-level date, monitoring intent.
- **Release edition** (``lib2_release_editions``) — one concrete pressing:
  provider release IDs, country/label/barcode/status, media, disc count,
  release date, track count and a matching signature. Exactly one edition
  per group is ``is_default`` (enforced by a partial unique index).
- **Recording** (``lib2_recordings``) — the edition-independent audio
  identity (ISRC / MusicBrainz recording / Spotify track). This is what
  eventually replaces the unsafe ``canonical_track_id`` cluster.
- **Release track** (``lib2_release_tracks``) — a concrete position on an
  edition, pointing at exactly one recording and (compat) at the
  ``lib2_tracks`` row today's read/acquisition paths still use.

Identity rules (the audit's hard requirement): recordings are merged ONLY on
shared hard identifiers — same ISRC, same MusicBrainz recording ID, or same
Spotify track ID. Titles never merge anything, so Live/Remaster/Radio Edit
variants keep separate recordings. Existing ``canonical_track_id`` links
whose pair shares no hard ID are recorded in ``lib2_recording_review`` as
findings for the user instead of being silently merged (§14.2 Schritt 3).

The migration is additive: ``backfill_editions`` creates one default edition
per album and one recording + release track per track, is idempotent, and
runs from both the schema-ensure step and the importer.

    """Give one freshly created ``lib2_tracks`` row its edition membership.

    dd28-10: autolink created catalog tracks but never called
    :func:`ensure_release_track`, so a newly imported track was invisible to
    every edition-scoped consumer (bundle matching, the acquisition catalog).
    The only thing that eventually attached it was ``backfill_editions``, which
    runs at schema-ensure/legacy-import time and pins whatever it finds to
    ``default_edition_id`` — regardless of which edition was actually
    downloaded. Because the backfill is idempotent per ``(edition, track)``,
    that mis-assignment then became permanent.

    Attaching at creation time keeps the default-edition fallback (we usually
    genuinely do not know the edition) but lets a caller that DOES know pass
    ``edition_id`` and get it right the first time. Idempotent; does not commit.

    deleted tracks.

    iss32-M05 — this used to ``fetchall()`` every unmaterialized album and
    track and write them all inside the caller's single transaction. On
    Nezreka's 69,296 albums / 307,885 tracks that held SQLite's only write
    lock for nine minutes: every enrichment worker, the automation engine and
    the config save saw ``database is locked``, and the run reported no
    progress at all because the next checkpoint only comes after the step.

    It now walks both sources by keyset in ``batch_size`` chunks. Pass
    ``connection`` to get a real ``COMMIT`` after every batch — that is what
    turns the nine-minute lock into a sequence of short ones and gives
    :mod:`core.library2.wal` a window to checkpoint in. Without it the
    behaviour is the old one (single transaction, caller commits), which is
    what the importer's own finalize and the test suite rely on.

    ``progress(stage, done, total)`` is called once per batch, ``on_batch()``
    after each commit (the WAL checkpoint hook), and ``should_stop()`` is
    polled between batches so a shutdown does not have to wait out a full
    library. Stopping early is safe: the predicate is "not yet materialized",
    so the next run continues where this one left off.
