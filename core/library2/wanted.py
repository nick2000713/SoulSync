"""Materialized wanted projection for Library v2 (audit §11.2, ADR-02 Stufe 2).

``lib2_monitor_rules`` records WHY entities are (un)monitored; the
``monitored`` flags remain a compatibility projection. This module owns
``lib2_wanted_tracks``, the effective
wanted state PER TRACK consumed by acquisition/mirroring and computed from
the rules alone, with the deciding
rule level recorded — fast to query, idempotent for acquisition, and
auditable when it disagrees with a flag.

Priority (the audit demands this be pinned in tests before use; see
``tests/library2/test_wanted_projection.py``):

1. **explicit track rule** (``user_explicit``) — a direct user decision on
   exactly this track beats everything, in both directions (P1-14).
2. **imported Wishlist track rule** (``wishlist_import``) — a concrete
   admin-Wishlist item beats inherited album/artist state.
3. **projected track rule** (``cascade`` / ``new_release``) — the most
   recent bulk action projected onto this track (album toggle cascade,
   profile-assign opt-in, new-release enforcement).
4. **deliberate album rule** (anything except ``legacy_import``) — a runtime
   parent choice still beats file-derived upgrade monitoring.
5. **imported file track rule** (``file_import``) — a concrete local file is
   monitored for upgrades even when its release has a derived, incomplete
   ``legacy_import`` baseline.
6. **derived album rule** (``legacy_import``) — decides otherwise unruled
   tracks imported under the release.
7. **artist rule** — any provenance. Note: artist toggles never cascade
   flags onto tracks, so this level is exactly the "monitored heißt nicht
   gesucht" gap (P1-13) the projection closes.
8. **legacy track rule** (``legacy_import``) — a flag whose origin is
   unknown ranks below deliberate parent rules but above the default.
9. **default: unmonitored** — no recorded intent anywhere means not wanted.

Album rules therefore retain their old authority when they reflect a user or
runtime action. Only the importer's derived incomplete-parent baseline is
overridden by concrete file coverage.

``wanted`` is the effective *intent*: whether acquisition should consider
the track at all. Whether a wanted track actually queues (missing file,
upgrade candidate) stays a live decision of the acquisition path
(``wishlist_mirror``) — file state is deliberately NOT materialized here.
