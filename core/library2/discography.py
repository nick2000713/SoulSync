"""Expand a Library-v2 artist with their full provider discography.

Lidarr shows *everything* an artist ever released (from its metadata provider)
and lets the user monitor any album/EP/single — owned or not. This module does
the same for Library v2: it fetches the artist's discography through SoulSync's
existing source-priority lookup (``core/metadata/discography.py`` — Spotify,
Deezer, iTunes, … with fallback) and persists every release as a ``lib2_albums``
row.

Persistence rules:
- Releases the library already has (matched by provider id or normalized title)
  are *enriched* in place (fill missing ids/artwork/dates/track counts) and keep
  ``origin='library'``.
- Genuinely new releases are inserted with ``origin='discography'`` and
  ``monitored=0`` — pure metadata, no wishlist side effects. Monitoring stays an
  explicit user action (the monitor endpoint materializes the tracklist and
  mirrors to the wishlist). ONE exception: on a *re*-expansion of a monitored
  artist, newly DISCOVERED releases are auto-monitored according to
  ``monitor_new_items``: 'all' accepts every discovery, while 'new' accepts
  only a dated release newer than the newest release known before this sync.
  Their ids come back in ``auto_monitor_album_ids`` so the caller can
  materialize + mirror them. The first expansion never does this — it would
  queue the whole back catalog in one click.
- Releases that disappeared from the provider are pruned again, but only when
  they are still pristine (no tracks, not monitored, origin='discography').
