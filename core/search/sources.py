"""Per-source metadata search.

Two public functions:

- `search_kind(client, query, kind, source_name=None)` — search a single
  result type (artists | albums | tracks) on one client and normalize the
  result to a list of plain dicts.

- `search_source(query, client, source_name=None)` — fan three
  search_kind calls out across a thread pool and return the merged dict.

Both swallow per-kind exceptions — search reliability matters more than
strict error propagation, and the route layer cannot do anything useful
with a single-kind failure.
