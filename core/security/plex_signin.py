"""sign in with plex.

plex's own pin flow, the one overseerr and tautulli use: soulsync asks
plex.tv for a pin, the user approves it on plex's site (soulsync never sees
their password), soulsync reads back their account token. from that:

- the account must be able to see THIS server, else no entry
- the server's owner (plex says so: the server is `owned` in their
  resources) signs in as the admin profile
- an account that signed in before signs in as the profile it got then.
  only plex sign-in records that; the home-user link never counts, since
  any profile can point it at any unprotected home user
- anyone else gets a new profile, if the admin allows it, with the admin's
  default role (request-only unless they say otherwise)

the profile then acts as that user on the server: their server token is
stored the way the home-user link stores one, so playlists land in their own
plex account through the existing per-user view. the account token itself is
never kept.
