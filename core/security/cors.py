"""CORS support for the JSON API (browser extensions, cross-origin clients).

Beckid: Firefox does not apply host-permission CORS bypass to extension
page fetches the way Chrome does, so the SoulSync Companion extension's
``fetch()`` calls from its popup/options pages are subject to normal CORS
and fail with ``NetworkError`` against a server that sends no CORS headers.
Verified Sep 2026 against Firefox 156 with a local extension + stub server:
even a background-context fetch with the host permission granted is
rejected; the same fetch succeeds once the server answers preflights and
sends ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin``.

Pure decision helpers (no Flask) so the behavior is unit-testable without
standing up the app. ``web_server.py`` wires them into a ``before_request``
preflight handler (registered BEFORE the login/launch-PIN gates — a
preflight carries no credentials and returns no data, so it must not be
gated; the real request still goes through auth) and an ``after_request``
response header hook.

Security: CORS alone grants nothing. Every ``/api/*`` route still enforces
its own auth (API key / session). ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: '*'`` is
used, matching several existing endpoints; browsers forbid combining ``*``
with credentialed requests, so session cookies cannot be leveraged
cross-origin. An arbitrary website still cannot call the API without the
user's key.
