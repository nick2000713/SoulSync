"""Which profile a web request acts as.

the old rule was ``session.get('profile_id', 1)``: no profile in the session
meant the admin. that turned three ordinary things into admin rights:

  * a member posting /api/profiles/logout (it popped profile_id, kept the
    login/launch-pin flags, and the next request was profile 1)
  * a member whose profile got deleted (the gate popped the stale id, and
    the next request was profile 1)
  * a fresh browser on a multi-profile install, before anyone picked a card

the rule now: a session profile wins. with none, a single-profile install is
still the admin (one person, trust the lan, nothing changes for them). with
more than one profile, or in login mode, no profile means no rights until one
is picked.

pure so the matrix is unit-testable without the app.
