"""Turn a free-text Deezer download query into an exact-title query.

The download pipeline hands a source one string, e.g. ``"aulii cravalho how far
ill go"``. Deezer's plain ``/search`` ranks reprises, karaoke and key-shifted
copies above the real song and, for some songs, leaves the real one out of the
result page entirely. Deezer's ``track:"title"`` filter does find it, but the
filter needs the title on its own and the string does not say where the artist
ends.

The first plain search tells us: its results carry artist names, and a name that
appears in the query marks the artist part. What is left is the title.

Pure functions only (no network, no config), so they are unit-testable offline.
