"""Wire the real cheapest-first sources for the export MBID waterfall (#903).

``mbid_resolver`` is the pure waterfall; this module supplies the real I/O behind each
source and assembles the ``resolve_fn`` the export job uses:

1. **cache** — ``recording_mbid_cache`` (persistent (artist,title)->mbid).
2. **DB** — a text-matched library track's ``tracks.musicbrainz_recording_id``.
3. **file** — ``MUSICBRAINZ_RECORDING_ID`` tag of that track's file (when the DB row had
   no recording id but the file was tagged on import).
4. **MusicBrainz** — live ``match_recording(track, artist)`` (rate-limited tail).

Every source is wrapped so any failure (missing table, unreadable file, MB timeout) returns
None — the waterfall just falls through, the export never breaks. ``build_resolve_fn`` also
writes a fresh non-cache hit back to the cache so the next export of the same song is free.
