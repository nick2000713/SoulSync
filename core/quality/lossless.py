"""Single source of truth for "is this audio lossless?" + the lossy-copy
overwrite invariant.

The "create a lossy copy of lossless tracks" feature lives in two places (the
import post-processing path and the Lossy Converter repair job). Both used to
hardcode ``.flac``, which is exactly how ALAC/WAV/DSD ended up being quality-
profile options but NOT lossy-copy sources (#941). The knowledge of which
formats are lossless now lives HERE, derived from the same format names the
quality model ranks, so adding a format lights it up in both sites at once and
they can never drift.

Two seams, both pure (no I/O) so they're unit-testable without real files:

* :func:`is_lossless_format` / :func:`is_lossless_audio_path` — eligibility.
  ``.m4a``/``.mp4`` are ambiguous (ALAC=lossless, AAC=lossy) and can only be told
  apart by codec, so the path check delegates them to an *injected* ``probe_codec``
  callable — the file I/O stays at the edge, the decision stays pure.
* :func:`lossy_output_would_overwrite_source` — the safety invariant: a lossy copy
  must NEVER be written over its own source (which becomes possible once ``.m4a``
  is eligible and the target codec is AAC → same ``.m4a`` path).
