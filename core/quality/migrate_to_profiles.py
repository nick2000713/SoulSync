"""One-time migration: materialize the user's pre-existing global quality
settings into the ``quality_profiles`` default row, and backfill existing
``wishlist_tracks`` rows with a pointer to that profile, so every wishlist
item is self-sufficient for the download/import pipeline instead of the
pipeline consulting a global setting.

Why this exists
----------------
Before this migration, ONE global singleton (``preferences.quality_profile``)
plus several separate global toggles (``acoustid.require_verified``,
``lossy_copy.downsample_hires``, ...) governed every download/import in the
app. Quality profiles are the single, app-wide, named, per-item-assignable
unit of configuration instead (see ``core/quality/schema.py``'s
``quality_profiles`` table). Users must not have to reconfigure anything on
upgrade: this migration reads whatever they already had configured and turns
it into the new ``is_default=1`` profile row, then stamps every existing
wishlist row with that profile's id so nothing changes behaviorally until the
user deliberately assigns a different profile.

Runs once, gated by a ``metadata`` table flag (the same gating pattern as
``MusicDatabase._normalize_genres_to_json``). Safe no-op on any error — never
blocks app startup.
