"""identify a mirrored track by its own id when the playlist and the
metadata source are the same service (#1566).

a mirrored deezer playlist already knows each track's deezer id. with deezer
as the metadata source, searching deezer by artist + title for that track can
only lose: the search can miss it or pick a reprise / karaoke version (#1565),
while /track/{id} is the exact track. same for spotify playlists with spotify
as the source.

returns the same Track object a search would, so the rest of identification
stores it unchanged. anything that doesn't pan out returns None and the
normal search runs, so this can never do worse than before.
