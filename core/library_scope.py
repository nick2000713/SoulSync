"""whose library a caller is looking at (#1199).

a profile can have a library of its own (its own output folder, its own
library on the media server). rows the scan of that library writes carry
the profile as owner; the shared library's rows carry none. the scope is:

  'shared'  the shared library: rows with no owner (today's library,
            exactly as before). the admin and every plain profile
  <int>     an own-library profile: its rows only
  None      every row of every library. nobody's default; a job that
            really needs all of it sets it explicitly

the admin is a user of the shared library like anyone else: a track that
only exists in someone's own library is not the admin's (a copy of their
own is the answer, by design), and their library page shows nothing of
another profile's.

resolved from the current profile (request or background) with a short
cache on the profile's mode so the db is not asked on every query. a
scan or a worker acting for one profile sets it explicitly.

This branch adds the admin's pick on top (E-04/E-11, see
docs/library-v2-dir-ownership.md): an admin chooses a library in the header,
and that choice is both what they see and where what they start lands. And
the library a DOWNLOAD belongs to is decided once, while the request still
exists, and travels on the batch (``library_owner_id``) -- the workers that
finish it run with no request and no session to ask.
