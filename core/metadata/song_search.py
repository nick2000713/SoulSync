"""search a metadata source for one song by one artist.

free-text search ("Numb Linkin Park") is what every source does by default,
and some of them are bad at it:

- deezer's free-text index skips tracks. "Numb Linkin Park" returns 50
  results with live cuts, covers and lullaby versions but never the studio
  Numb off Meteora, which is Linkin Park's #2 top track. the field-scoped
  form (Linkin Park track:"Numb") returns it first.
- itunes searches one country's store. songs missing from that store
  (E-Type, Helena Paparizou in the US) never come back (#1398).

search_song knows each source's better path, and keeps the free-text results
too so nothing the old search found goes missing. callers still rerank.
