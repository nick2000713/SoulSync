"""Per-source album-art lookups + availability for the cover-art picker.

Bridges the pure resolver in ``art_sources.py`` to the real metadata clients.
Each supported source contributes two things:

- **availability** — is this source usable for the current user right now?
  Free sources (CAA, Deezer, iTunes, AudioDB) are always available; account
  sources (Spotify) only when connected. This is what powers "not everybody
  has access to every source": the UI offers only available sources and the
  resolver skips the rest.
- **lookup** — ``(artist, album, metadata) -> cover_url | None``, calling an
  EXISTING client method. Every lookup is individually guarded so any error or
  miss degrades to ``None`` (the resolver then falls through to the next
  source, finally to the download's own art) — a flaky source can never raise
  into, or break, a download.

Lookups are cached per album via ``build_art_lookup`` so resolving art for a
16-track album hits each source at most once.

Client accessors are imported lazily inside each function to keep this module
import-light (the pure resolver + its tests never pull a network client).
