"""Track-level filters for the user-facing Download Discography flow.

GitHub issue #559 (trackhacs): clicking "Download Discography" on an
artist also pulled in tracks where the artist's name appeared in the
title of someone else's song. Two failure modes underneath:

1. **Cross-artist tracks.** Spotify's `artist_albums` endpoint returns
   compilation / appears_on / various-artists albums where the requested
   artist is featured on one or two tracks. The endpoint then added
   *every* track from those albums to the wishlist, including tracks by
   unrelated artists that just happened to mention the requested artist
   in the title.

2. **Remix / live / acoustic / instrumental versions.** The watchlist
   scanner has user-toggleable filters for these (default: exclude),
   stored at `watchlist.global_include_*`. The discography backfill
   repair job already honors them. The user-facing Download Discography
   endpoint did not — those filters never fired for one-off discography
   downloads, so users got remix-ladder bloat.

These helpers live alongside the existing `core.metadata.discography`
because they belong to the same conceptual layer (discography fetch
results, pre-wishlist) and are independently testable. The watchlist
content-type detectors (``is_remix_version`` etc.) are reused from
``core.watchlist_scanner`` rather than re-implemented — same patterns,
single source of truth.
