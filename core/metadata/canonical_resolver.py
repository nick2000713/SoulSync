"""Resolve (and persist) the canonical release for an album — Stage 2 of #765.

Stage 1 gave us the pure scorer (``core.metadata.canonical_version``). This
module turns it into an end-to-end resolver: gather the album's candidate
releases (one per metadata-source ID it has), score each against the on-disk
files, and return the best fit. Wiring (backfill job / enrichment hook) and the
DB store live alongside; the decision logic here is kept dependency-injected
(``fetch_tracklist`` is passed in) so it's fully unit-testable without live APIs
or real files.

Still NO consumer reads the result in Stage 2 — populating the columns is
behavior-neutral. Stages 3-4 wire the Reorganizer and Track Number Repair to
read it.

    ``file_tracks``: on-disk track metadata (``{duration_ms, title}``).
    ``fetch_tracklist(source, album_id)``: returns that release's tracklist (or
    None/[] on miss); injected so callers supply ``get_album_tracks_for_source``

    ``source_priority``: source order; ties break toward the earlier source.
    ``primary_source``: the user's active metadata source (defaults to the first
    of ``source_priority``).

    Modes:
      - ``active_preferred`` (default): use the active source's release when the
        album has an ID for it AND it clears ``min_score``; otherwise fall back
        to the best-fit among the remaining sources. So it normally respects the
        user's configured source but self-heals when that link is clearly wrong.
      - ``active_only``: only ever the active source (pinned if it clears the
        floor; never considers other sources).
      - ``best_fit``: whichever source's release best matches the files.

    Returns an enriched dict for the chosen release — ``source``, ``album_id``,
    ``score``, the per-signal breakdown (``count_fit``/``duration_fit``/
    ``title_fit``), ``file_track_count`` vs ``release_track_count``, and a
