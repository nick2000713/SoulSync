"""Release-date gating (#705): keep unreleased tracks out of hot paths.

Watchlist scans intentionally pick up ANNOUNCED albums — singles drop early,
the rest of the tracklist carries a future release date. Two places must not
treat those as available:

  - the wishlist auto-processor: searching Soulseek for a track that isn't
    out yet burns a full search+timeout per track, every cycle
  - the Fresh Tape / Release Radar builder: future albums got NEGATIVE
    days_old, which INFLATED their recency score (100 - days*7) above every
    released track — prereleases weren't just slipping in, they were favored

Spotify-style dates come in three precisions: YYYY, YYYY-MM, YYYY-MM-DD.
The gate is deliberately conservative: a track is "unreleased" only when the
date is CONFIDENTLY in the future at its stated precision. Unparseable or
missing dates are treated as released (never block on bad data), and a
release dated today counts as released — release-day tracks should flow.
