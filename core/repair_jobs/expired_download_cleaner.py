"""Expired Download Cleaner (Boulder) — retention-based cleanup of
origin-tracked downloads.

Watchlist- and playlist-sourced downloads (recorded by the Download Origins
provenance) get a per-origin retention window. Past it, a download is proposed
for deletion UNLESS it's still in an actively-mirrored playlist / watched
artist, or you've played it more than once. By default it creates findings to
review; flip ``auto_delete`` to true for hands-off cleanup.

The expiry decision is the pure core in core.library.expired_cleanup; this job
gathers the facts (play_count via DB, active-mirror/watch protection) and
deletes via the shared helper the Download Origins delete also conceptually
uses (resolve path → remove file → drop track row → drop history row).
