"""Repair job: detect ~30s PREVIEW clips and re-fetch the full track.

The HiFi endpoint (and occasionally others) sometimes deliver a ~30-second preview/sample
instead of the full song. Those land in the library looking like real tracks. This job
finds short tracks, looks up the EXPECTED length from the track's metadata source, and —
when the source says the real track is meaningfully longer than the file — flags it as a
preview clip.

Approving the finding (in repair_worker._fix_short_preview_track) deletes the preview file,
drops the DB row so the track goes missing again, and re-adds it to the wishlist with a full
payload so the real version gets downloaded. The scan itself ONLY creates findings — nothing
is deleted, removed, or wishlisted without the user approving, exactly like the other tools.

Conservative by design (it deletes a file): a track is only flagged when the source confirms
it should be much longer. Genuine short tracks (intros, skits, interludes — where the source
agrees the track is short) are left alone, and tracks whose length can't be verified from a
source are skipped, never flagged.
