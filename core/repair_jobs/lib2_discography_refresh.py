"""Periodic Library-v2 discography re-expansion (monitor_new_items enforcement).

``monitor_new_items`` promises that newly discovered ('all') or genuinely newer
('new') releases of a monitored artist become wanted automatically — but the enforcement lives in the
discography *re-expansion* path, which used to run only when the user pressed
"Update Discography". This job runs that same re-expansion on a schedule for
every monitored artist, so the promise holds without manual clicks — including
an artist that was only ever imported/watchlisted and never had its provider
catalog fetched (review A5): a monitored artist whose first fetch happens to
land on this sweep instead of a manual click is not a special case downstream.
``_expand_artist_discography``'s own ``eligible_reexpansion`` gate (it requires
``had_discography`` — i.e. NOT this artist's first-ever fetch) already keeps a
first expansion from auto-monitoring the whole back catalog, first-fetched-by-
sweep or first-fetched-by-click alike, so this job doesn't need its own
first-expansion guard on top of that.

Scope rules:
- Only monitored artists with ``monitor_new_items`` != 'none'.
- Newly discovered releases are materialized + mirrored via the same shared
  helper the API endpoint uses (``discography.auto_monitor_releases``), so the
  two paths cannot drift.

Scheduled runs have no request context; wishlist mirrors are scoped to the
admin profile (1), matching every other scheduled acquisition path. No-op when
the native Library-v2 catalogue. Never touches files.
