"""Periodic Library-v2 quality-upgrade scan.

Re-checks every monitored Library-v2 track that HAS a file under an upgrade
policy (``until_top``/``until_cutoff``) and queues genuine upgrade candidates
into the Wishlist — same logic as the manual "Search Upgrades" button
(``core/library2/wishlist_mirror``), just on the repair-worker cadence so
upgrades keep flowing without the user pressing anything.

No-op when ``features.library_v2`` is off. Never touches files.
