"""Quality Info Backfill — re-measures real audio quality for already
imported Library-v2 files whose bitrate/sample-rate/bit-depth was never
actually probed (review A4, clarified: the gap is library entries with no
quality info shown, not files with no DB row at all — that's a separate,
narrower problem the review also flagged but which isn't handled here).

``core.library2.scan`` explains the root cause directly: "The importer seeds
file rows from the legacy DB, which only reliably knows format+bitrate."
Sample-rate and bit-depth — the facts hi-res/lossless quality tiers actually
need — only get filled in when someone manually presses "Refresh & Scan" for
that one album/artist. A track imported before that habit existed, or
downloaded through a path that skipped the probe, keeps NULL sample_rate/
bit_depth forever and its quality badge/tier can never be judged correctly.

This job finds exactly those rows and re-probes them with the same
ground-truth reader "Refresh & Scan" uses
(``core.library2.scan.rescan_files`` -> ``core.imports.file_ops
.probe_audio_quality``, mutagen), just swept across the whole library on a
schedule instead of requiring N manual per-album clicks. Purely additive:
``rescan_files`` only fills currently-NULL columns (COALESCE), never
overwrites a good measured value, so running this is always safe — auto_fix
because there's nothing to review, only real quality facts get written.

Runs against the native Library-v2 catalogue. Never touches files.
