"""Genre Tag Cleanup Job — re-applies the strict genre whitelist to genres
stored BEFORE it was enabled (#1057, follow-up to #321).

Strict genre filtering gates NEW enrichment fetches; anything enriched earlier
keeps its off-whitelist genres in artists.genres / albums.genres, and every
downstream surface (server metadata sync, Write Tags before its own #1057
filter) reproduces them. This job is the mop: when strict mode is ON it scans
stored genres, raises a finding per artist/album whose genre list the whitelist
would shrink, and the fix rewrites the stored list to the kept genres only.

Report-only until approved (auto_fix = False). The fix never invents genres —
it only removes; an entity whose genres are ALL off-whitelist ends up with none
(strict means strict), and the finding says so up front. With strict mode OFF
the scan is a no-op skip, so the job is safe to leave enabled.
