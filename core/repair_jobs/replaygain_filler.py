"""ReplayGain Filler maintenance job (#437) — the loudness sibling of the Lyrics
and Cover Art fillers.

Post-processing applies ReplayGain to slskd/WebUI downloads, but content that
enters the library another way — Lidarr, the REST API, manual adds — never gets
it, and there was no way to (re)apply RG to existing tracks or fix the ones where
analysis failed (a recurring ask on #437).

This scans the library for tracks with no ReplayGain track-gain tag and creates a
finding for each. Applying a finding runs the same ffmpeg ebur128 analysis the
import pipeline uses and writes the RG tags in place — no moves, no re-matching.

Scan only READS tags (cheap); the expensive ffmpeg analysis happens on apply.
Requires ffmpeg (RG analysis can't run without it), so the scan no-ops when ffmpeg
isn't on PATH rather than surfacing findings that could never be applied.
