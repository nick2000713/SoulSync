"""Guard against char-level title false positives in track matching.

Issue #769: playlist sync matched tracks that aren't in the library to a
DIFFERENT song by the SAME artist, with high confidence — e.g. "Dani
California" -> "Californication" (Red Hot Chili Peppers), "Under The Bridge"
-> "Around the World". The confidence formula is ``0.5*title + 0.5*artist``,
and a same-artist comparison always yields ``artist = 1.0``, so the title score
is the only thing that can tell two of an artist's songs apart. But the title
score is a ``difflib.SequenceMatcher`` character ratio, which over-credits
unrelated titles that happen to share a long substring ("californi…") or only a
stopword ("the"): 0.67 and 0.62 respectively. With the flat 0.5 artist term
that lands at 0.83 / 0.81 — well over the 0.7 sync threshold.

``titles_plausibly_same`` adds a cheap word-level sanity check on top of the
char ratio: accept a pair only when it's near-identical char-wise (so typos and
punctuation/casing variants — "Beleive"/"Believe", "HUMBLE."/"Humble" — still
match) OR the two titles share at least one significant (non-stopword) token.
Two genuinely different songs by the same artist share no content word, so they
get rejected; the real track is then correctly reported missing.
