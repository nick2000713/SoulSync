"""Startup reconciliation for abandoned atomic-album staging trees (#1289).

Atomic album publishing (#999) parks a batch's finished tracks under
``<library>/.soulsync_atomic_staging/<batch id>/`` until the whole album is
ready. The publish that empties that tree is driven entirely from
``download_batches``, which is a dict in the web process, so a restart, a crash
or an OOM anywhere in the middle of an album leaves the tree behind with nobody
left who knows what it is.

Nothing in SoulSync looked at it afterwards. The dot prefix hides it from every
media server; SoulSync's own scanner and the repair jobs prune it explicitly.
The audio was complete, tagged and correctly named, and permanently invisible.
The only code that ever touched an abandoned tree again deleted it.

So: at startup, before any new batch can claim a staging directory, walk what is
on disk and finish the job.

On publishing a recovered album
-------------------------------
Recovering publishes the tracks the interrupted batch had actually finished,
which can mean an album that is not yet complete becomes visible. That does not
weaken #999's guarantee, which is about what the media server sees *while an
album is downloading* — that path is untouched, and a live batch still publishes
all-or-nothing at completion. Here the download is already over; the choice is
between an album that fills in and an album that never appears at all.

It also composes with the rest of the flow rather than fighting it: the tracks
the batch never finished are still on the wishlist (that is the other half of
#1289), and when they are downloaded later the album folder is no longer fresh,
so ``album_folder_is_fresh`` routes them through the ordinary per-track publish
straight into the now-existing album. Recovered audio is never re-downloaded,
and the album completes itself.

Users who would rather keep strict quarantine can set
``album_downloads.atomic_recover_orphans`` to false; the trees are then reported
and left alone, never deleted.
