"""Atomic album publishing (#999) — opt-in, default off.

When ``album_downloads.atomic_publish`` is on, an album batch's tracks are
post-processed into a private STAGING mirror of their final library paths
instead of straight into the media-library ("transfer") folder, and are moved
into the library only once the WHOLE batch completes — so Plex/Jellyfin/
Navidrome never sees a partial album mid-download. If the batch never completes,
the staged files stay out of the library (quarantine) and the failed tracks stay
retryable in the wishlist.

This module is PURE mechanics — path math + move + DB path fix-up. Every gate
decision and all wiring live at the call sites (the pipeline redirect and the
batch-complete publish), behind the config flag. Nothing here reads config or
touches global state, so it is trivially unit-testable and, until wired, inert.

Scope guardrails baked in here (defensive; the call sites also gate):
  * ``to_staging_path`` returns None unless the final path is genuinely UNDER the
    transfer dir — we never stage a path we can't map back, so a bad input falls
    through to today's direct-publish behavior rather than misplacing a file.
  * ``album_folder_is_fresh`` lets callers restrict atomic mode to a NEW album
    folder (empty / absent), so a completeness-fill into an album the user
    already owns is never re-staged (avoids any quality-replace surprise on an
    existing file — that path keeps today's per-track publish).

# The staging tree lives as a hidden folder INSIDE the transfer dir.

# mkdir raised PermissionError, the track never left downloads, and the user

# not found after processing" with every file still sitting in /app/downloads.
