"""On-disk manifest for an atomic album batch (#1289).

Atomic album publishing (#999) keeps a batch's finished tracks in a private
staging tree until the whole album is ready. Everything that knows what that
tree IS — which batch owns it, which library it belongs to, which wishlist
requests its files satisfy — lived in ``download_batches``, a plain dict in the
web process. When the process went away mid-batch, so did all of it, and the
staging tree became an anonymous pile of audio that no scanner looks at
(``.soulsync_atomic_staging`` is deliberately skipped by SoulSync's own scan,
by the repair jobs, and by every media server, because it is dot-prefixed).

This module writes the missing half to disk, next to the files it describes, so
a later process can pick the tree up and finish the job. It is deliberately
dumb: JSON, one file per batch, atomically replaced, best-effort everywhere. A
manifest that fails to write must never fail a download — the worst it costs is
a slower recovery.

Pure mechanics, like ``atomic_album_publish``: no config reads, no globals, no
database.
