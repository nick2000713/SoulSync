/**
 * The sync page's controller: everything the page needs, assembled once.
 *
 * Split from the JSX deliberately. The wiring is where this port's failures
 * have lived — a second pipeline controller, an unreachable global, a superset
 * standing in for display order — and none of them are visible in markup. The
 * panel mounting is mechanical by comparison, so it stays in the component and
 * this stays testable on its own.
 *
 * THE ENGINE IS RESOLVED AT CALL TIME, not at mount. Every member reads its
 * `window` function inside the closure, so a page that mounts before the
 * vanilla scripts finish still works, and a missing global is a no-op rather
 * than a crash at construction. `isSyncing` and the playlist list are the two
 * that needed accessors added (core.js) — `activeSyncPollers` and
 * `spotifyPlaylists` are top-level `let`s and have no window property at all.
