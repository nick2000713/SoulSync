/**
 * The Recently Played band — listening history's dashboard front door.
 *
 * Rows come from /api/stats/recent, the same listening_history spine the
 * stats page reads (media-server plays via the listening-stats worker +
 * SoulSync web-player plays).
 *
 * Clicking a card PLAYS the song again — library first, streaming second, the
 * same ladder Recently Added uses (Boulder: "clicking elsewhere on the card
 * should begin playing that song from your library if available... if song
 * isn't available, then stream it"). The band originally went to the stats
 * page from anywhere on the card, which made the most obvious gesture on a
 * rail of songs do the one thing you cannot do to a song. The header still
 * leads to the full ledger, and the artist line still leads to the artist.
 *
 * These rows carry no file path — /api/stats/recent is a play LEDGER, not a
 * library view — so the title+artist resolve in playTrackByMetadata is how a
 * card finds its file. That is also why an unmatched play still works: it
 * falls through to the stream source instead of doing nothing.
 *
 * Renders NOTHING until history exists (listening stats off, or a fresh
 * install) — same calm-page rule as the content band. Speaks the content
 * band's exact card vocabulary (ya-card / dash-rail-*) so the two rails read
 * as siblings and it costs zero new card CSS.
