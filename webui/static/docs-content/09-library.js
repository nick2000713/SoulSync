The Library page shows every artist in your collection as cards with images, album and track counts, and **service badges** — Spotify, MusicBrainz, Deezer, Discogs, AudioDB, iTunes, Last.fm, Genius, Tidal, Qobuz — indicating which services have matched each artist.

## Browsing

- **Search bar** — find artists by name
- **Alphabet navigation** (A–Z, #) — jump through large collections
- **Watchlist filter** — All, Watched, or Unwatched artists
- **Metadata source filter** — find artists unmatched to a specific service (e.g. "No Discogs") or matched to one (e.g. "Has Spotify")

Click any artist card to open their detail page: albums, EPs, and singles as cards with completion percentages. Filter by category, content type (live, compilations, featured), or status (owned, missing). **View on** buttons at the top link the artist on each matched external service.

            body: `
The Library route opens **Library v2** directly. Management actions are part of that page; there is no separate Enhanced toggle.

Catalogue tracks and their physical files are managed separately. **File versions** shows the copies held for a track, and **Recording duplicates** reviews linked single/album recordings. Removal actions preview the selected catalogue entries and file paths before applying changes. Available actions depend on your profile permissions and selected library.

            body: `
Library v2 exposes provider links and matching actions on catalogue entities. The available services depend on the entity and its stored provider IDs.

- Click any chip to **manually search and link** the correct external ID when automatic matching gets it wrong
- Run per-service **enrichment** from the Enrich dropdown to pull in metadata from a specific source
- Matched services show as clickable badges linking to the entity on that service's website

Good matches are the foundation of everything downstream — discovery, similar artists, and metadata quality all depend on correct service links.

::: steps
1. Open a track's **⋯** menu and choose **Write tags to file** — or an album's **⋯** menu and choose **Write all tags to files** — or select tracks and use the bulk bar's **Write tags**.
2. A **tag preview modal** shows a diff table: current file tags vs. database values.
3. Optionally enable **Embed cover art** and **Sync to server**.
4. Click **Write Tags** to apply the changes to the file.

![Tag preview modal](lib-tags.jpg)

Supports MP3, FLAC, OGG, and M4A via Mutagen. After writing, optional server sync pushes metadata to Plex (per-track update), Jellyfin (library scan), or Navidrome (auto-detects changes).

From any album card showing missing tracks, click **Download Missing** to open a modal listing every track not in your library. Select tracks, choose a download source, and start the download — progress is tracked per track with status indicators.

**Multi-disc albums** are handled automatically: tracks organize into \`Disc N/\` subfolders within the album directory, preventing track number collisions (Disc 1 Track 1 vs Disc 2 Track 1). Disc structure is detected from Spotify or iTunes metadata.

Library v2 previews the affected entries and file paths before removal:

- **Remove from library database only** — removes the selected library records and keeps the physical files on disk.
- **Permanently delete files** — removes the corresponding records and disk files after explicit confirmation. Paths outside configured Music Library Paths, or on unavailable storage, are blocked.

File-removal operations are recorded in the deletion journal. Permanent deletion cannot be undone by reopening a finding. Maintenance fixes that move files into the deleted-files quarantine are recorded as quarantine operations instead; the confirmation for that action describes the move.

A 3-step wizard guides you through redownloading a specific track:

::: steps
1. **Choose metadata source** — confirm the correct track identity (Spotify, iTunes, or Deezer match).
2. **Choose download source** — search across all configured download sources (Soulseek, Tidal, Qobuz, YouTube, HiFi, Deezer) and pick a specific result.
3. **Download & replace** — the new file replaces the existing one with updated metadata and tags.

            body: `
The Issues page is the **manual issue tracker**: nothing here is ever written by a scan — every row is a problem reported by a person (profiles can file them from library pages and the player). Automated scan findings live in **Library Maintenance** on the Tools page, a deliberately separate surface.

Issues are grouped by category — wrong track, wrong metadata, wrong cover, wrong artist, wrong album, duplicate tracks, missing tracks, audio quality, incomplete album, other — each with a status (**open**, **in progress**, **resolved**, **dismissed**) and a priority (**low**, **normal**, **high**). Filter by status and category to work through them, and update issues individually or in bulk.

> [!NOTE]
> The **"witness me"** type-the-phrase confirmation doesn't live here — it gates bulk orphan deletes in **Library Maintenance**: a delete targeting more than 20 orphan findings where at least one finding carries the backend's \`mass_orphan\` flag. But the current backend never sets that flag — when the orphan-file scan trips its mass-orphan guard (over half the scanned files look like orphans, which usually means a DB↔filesystem path mismatch rather than real orphans), it refuses to create any findings at all, so the confirmation can't trigger today.
