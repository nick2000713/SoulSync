// `VERSION_MODAL_SECTIONS` (this block) is the curated highlight reel shown

//
// Both consts live here so a release editor only opens one file. At release

//   1. Add the per-version block to `WHATS_NEW` (one entry per shipped item).
//   2. Promote any items worth a modal-section into `VERSION_MODAL_SECTIONS`
//      at the top of the array (latest highlights lead).
